            "description": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. It built on ideas explored in their earlier recordings and live shows, and incorporated progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock into a concept album about conflict, greed, and unexplained death. The album's title is derived from a line in the book The Wizard of Oz, and the cover art, designed by Storm Thorgerson, depicts a prism splitting a beam of light into a rainbow.",
